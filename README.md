# [dblurt](https://gitlab.com/blurt)

Robust blurt client library that runs in both node.js and the browser.

Needs test net urls, chain id

---

**note** As of version 0.7.0 WebSocket support has been removed. The only transport provided now is HTTP(2). For most users the only change required is to swap `wss://` to `https://` in the address. If you run your own full node make sure to set the proper [CORS headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) if you plan to access it from a browser.
